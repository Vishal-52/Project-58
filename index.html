        <div class="line"></div>
        <p id="para">Cricket is the most popular outdoor game in the world.
            Amongst all the outdoor games, cricket is my favourite and I love to play this game.
            It is the most watched sport in India and people have an emotional connect towards it.
            This sport is played by using a bat and a ball between two teams of 11 members each.
            Every team has its own set of batsmen, bowlers and fielders.
            My favourite cricketer is MS Dhoni and I love the way he plays the game.
            I love to play cricket with my friends, after school, on the playground nearby.</p>
